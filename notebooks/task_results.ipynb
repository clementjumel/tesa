      "Kirk Fordham, who worked in former Repr Mark Foley 's office until Jan 2004, says he informed Speaker Dennis Hastert 's [J. Dennis Hastert] chief of staff Scott Palmer of report of` inappropriate behavior' [Scott Palmer] by Foley toward male House pages before 2004. Fordham resigns as chief of staff [Scott Palmer] to New York Repr Thomas Reynolds, saying he has become political liability. Palmer [Scott Palmer] denies account but assertion raises more questions about Hastert 's [J. Dennis Hastert] response to warnings and further clouds his [Scott Palmer] future as speaker. Fordham says he had more than one conversation with senior aides at highest levels of House, asking them to intervene after hearing from House clerk Jeff Trandahl that pages considered Foley` way too friendly'. Trandahl resigned last year. Fordham says he spoke with Palmer between 2001 and end of 2003. Timeline. Angry Republicans say latest disclosures solidify worries that Foley 's open conduct was kept quiet for election purposes. Republican Repr Deborah Pryce asks current House clerk Karen Hass to investigate report that Foley was once turned away from pages' living quarters and that staff raised concerns with Trandahl. Majority whip Roy Blunt says he was not told about issue until last week. Criticizes Hastert 's [J. Dennis Hastert] response. Congressional officials are directed by federal prosecutors to safeguard Foley 's computer and other office material. They have changed locks, stopped Foley 's remote access to computers and warned staffers not to shred documents. Fordham says he is maligned by suggestion that he covered up for Foley.

Report shows record number of homes entered foreclosure process in fourth quarter. Also indicates that problems that had previously been limited to economically weak areas were cropping up in more vibrant places like California. Finds that about 0.54 percent of all home loans entered foreclosure in fourth quarter. Problems were most heavily concentrated among subprime mortgages, but default rates also increased on loans made to prime borrowers and on loans that are part of government programs. Delinquency and foreclosure rates are highest in states like Ohio and Indiana, which are suffering from loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs, and Louisiana and Mississippi on Gulf Coast, where slow pace of reconstruction has worsened pain from hurricane damage. Big states like Massachusetts, Colorado, Georgia and Texas also had high and rising foreclosure rates. New Century Financial says Securities and Exchange Commission [Securities and Exchange Commission] and federal grand jury are seeking documents in investigations into trading in its [Securities and Exchange Commission] shares and accounting errors. Accredited Home Lenders [Accredited Home Lenders] says it [Accredited Home Lenders] is facing cash squeeze because of margin calls from its banks and is considering` strategic alternatives'. Residential Capital [Residential Capital], mortgage division of GMAC [Residential Capital], reports operating loss of$ 651 million for fourth quarter, compared to profit of$ 118 million year ago, because of rising losses and reserves for future losses in its [Residential Capital] subprime business. Sen Christopher Dodd says government might have to step in to provide aid to struggling homeowners.

        <p>With the same prophetic wisdom that predicted Jim Thorpe's Olympic triumphs in 1912, Cassius Clay's victory over Sonny Liston in 1964, and the Stanley Cup landing in Texas -- Texas! -- in 1999, Times sportswriters look into the future from their press boxes.</p>
        <p>It was not until after the Players' Riot of 2019, in which hundreds of fans were injured and two died, that America began to take seriously the possibility that sports was no national campfire but rather a dangerously out-of-control brush fire that could consume the entire country. The President's hastily assembled  Rocker Commission summed up the situation in this plaintive statement:  ''Twenty years ago, a grown man in a New York Rangers jersey would be an object of mild amusement. Ten years ago, he would be questioned by mental health authorities. Today, he would be detained by the police as a potential terrorist. How has this happened?''</p>

        <p>With the same prophetic wisdom that predicted Jim Thorpe's Olympic triumphs in 1912, Cassius Clay's victory over Sonny Liston in 1964, and the Stanley Cup landing in Texas -- Texas! -- in 1999, Times sportswriters look into the future from their press boxes.</p>
        <p>It was not until after the Players' Riot of 2019, in which hundreds of fans were injured and two died, that America began to take seriously the possibility that sports was no national campfire but rather a dangerously out-of-control brush fire that could consume the entire country. The President's hastily assembled  Rocker Commission summed up the situation in this plaintive statement:  ''Twenty years ago, a grown man in a New York Rangers jersey would be an object of mild amusement. Ten years ago, he would be questioned by mental health authorities. Today, he would be detained by the police as a potential terrorist. How has this happened?''</p>
        <p>How indeed has the relationship between athlete and fan become one of such mutual rage that the Plexiglas walls of hockey arenas have been extended to completely enclose the rinks. Basketball games are once again played inside metal cages. Because the armed guards at major baseball and football games were mostly retired players, they refused to open fire when the athletes finally stormed the stands. They watched the carnage with detachment, if not some delight.</p>
        <p>Why did love turn into hate?</p>
        <p>The commission's anthology of learned answers was predictable and unsatisfying: social, economic and physical disparities, it maintained, had created such a psychological gulf that ''player regarded fan as 'the other' and fan objectified the player as a cartoon figure, thus removing any common ground of humanity and empathy.''</p>
        <p>As the commission chairman, Prof. John Rocker, a distinguished historian and psycho-analyst, pointed out: ''From my own experience as a young player, I can understand how ignorance and fear, inflamed by media stereotypes, can lead to the breakdown of society. Frankly, it was just a matter of time. Look at history.''</p>
        <p>That the Players' Riot (the Players' Association preferred to call it the Players' Defense) occurred 100 years after the 20th century's sports nadir -- the 1919 Black Sox scandal -- and 50 years after its zenith -- the year in which the Jets and the Mets won championships and the Knicks began their great title run -- was proof to some that it was merely the dip of a cycle. In time, sports would swing back into the national affection.</p>
        <p>But the commission, calling the Riot a watershed event from which sports might never fully recover, cited a series of smaller events that had led up to it:</p>
        <p>*By the turn of the century, the amoral, outrageous, thrill-driven sensibility of professional wrestling had pushed other sports to turn up their heat. Purists were most concerned about Major League Baseball's secret quota of one bench-clearing fight per team per month, with pacifists fined.</p>
        <p>*Extreme sports, a short-lived pastime for increasingly short-lived people, was eventually banned; the ABC show ''Snuff Sport,'' in which it was alleged that ambulance crews were purposely given misdirections, is still defending lawsuits. But harpoon fights between teams in war canoes and dogfights between World War I fighter plane replicas created a climate in which recreational athletes became ashamed to play noncontact sports like golf, tennis and softball. Thus, spectatorship rose dramatically.</p>
        <p>*Those who continued to want to compete in some way turned to Virtual Games (known also as Zelig Games) in which hologram representations were inserted into classic and later live events. Eventually, a generation raised with advanced video skills was able to win in mock contests with real athletes, often by cheating.</p>
        <p>*As traditional male sports continued to be devalued, women's sports ascended. Women's tennis, soccer and volleyball eclipsed the men's games, while it became necessary in men's minor-league baseball, football and basketball to require a certain number of female athletes per team to assure attendance. There was great controversy over the possibility of such requirements in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>*Cablevision's computerized ''call-the-shot meters,'' enabling fans to vote on such coaching decisions as run-pass or substitutions in specified games, was a sensation for several seasons, especially after bad decisions were purposely sent in by gamblers. But then Fox Interactive introduced betting on individual plays, and fans voted with their wallets.</p>
        <p>*With ballparks and arenas no more than stage sets (ESPN's attempt to use digitized crowds was blocked by the actors' guilds), the so-called moderate, or cultural, fans, once seen occasionally at major events, disappeared. There were only the corporate fans in the luxury sky boxes and the hard-core fans in the hard seats.</p>
        <p>It was the mounting tension between the hard-cores and the players while the sky boxers egged them all on, according to the Rocker Commission, that set the scene for the Riot.</p>
        <p>The game in which it occured, between the Gainesville Dells and the South Bend Compaqs of the Microsoft League, was the renewal of a traditionally violent rivalry. The two cities were still reeling over the demise of Division I college football, set in motion by a minor scandal at Notre Dame in 1999.</p>
        <p>The National Football League had easily established minor league teams, administered by former college athletic departments, but they were seen as mercenary gangs who didn't even pretend to read or write.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Leaguers, a volatile mix of high school stars and N.F.L. has-beens, played a particularly brutal game while their fans frequently fought in the stands. They were urged on by skyboxers who floated flaming dollar bills down among the hoi polloi.</p>
        <p>On this Thursday night, despite dogs, sky-cams, metal detectors and random  frisks, a fan smuggled a folding plastic cross-bow into the stadium. Late in a close game, an arrow hit a 400-pound lineman in the buttock. When he eventually noticed, he became enraged and led both teams over the moat, past the guards, through the electrified fence and into the stands. Apparently assuming that it would become another Dells versus Compaqs free-for-all, fans stood up to meet them.</p>
        <p>But this time, the players were loyal to each other, not to uniforms. It was athletes versus fans, and with few exceptions, it was no contest. The massacre ended because the players, exhausted from the game, ran out of steam and allowed those fans still standing to run away.</p>
        <p>The guards regrouped and raced up to protect the sky-box level, which was spared. This is probably why few athletes were charged with felonies.</p>
        <p>Six months later, Professor Rocker had tears in his eyes when he announced the findings of his commission.</p>
        <p>''We have become two Americas, jock and fan,'' he said. ''Two peoples who need each other desperately have somehow been divided. I would fear for the future of the nation, if I didn't see a positive in all this.</p>
        <p>''Both groups, jock and fan, are remarkably similar, filled with immigrants who don't speak good English, gays, ex-cons, and even some 20-year-old single moms. Remembering my own misguided, yet somehow prophetic, remarks of the last century, I am filled with hope that we finally have something here to build on.''</p>

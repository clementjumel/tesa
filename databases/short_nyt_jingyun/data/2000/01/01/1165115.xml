        <p>As the world slid nervously yesterday through the shadow of its first global technology challenge, many year 2000 experts took special comfort in the relatively stable behavior of one of their principal tools in dealing with the problem: the not-always-reliable Internet.</p>
        <p>Service in the vast network of networks linking 60 million computers and more than 150 million users sagged at times in isolated sites as Internet users turned to e-mail messages, Web sites, newsgroups and electronic chat rooms to track the Year 2000's arrival in more and more time zones.</p>
        <p>But experts who mounted the most extensive effort ever to monitor the Internet's global reliability said that the overall performance was impressive and crossed their fingers as the Internet headed into peak usage hours last night.</p>
        <p>''We might look back on this as graduation day for the Internet,'' said Michael L. Todd, a computer consultant in Irvine, Calif., who heads the Los Angeles chapter of the Internet Society, an international organization of Internet users and developers.</p>
        <p>The sense that the Internet was facing a trial of sorts during the Year 2000 rollover had grown steadily in recent weeks. Some hospitals, government agencies and manufacturers decided to close World Wide Web sites or cut off e-mail messaging during the rollover after hearing predictions that hackers would be treating the year 2000 as an occasion to spread computer viruses.</p>
        <p>And a poll last week by the Information Technology Association of America, done over the Internet, reported that technology managers viewed the Internet as more likely to be hit by problems than any other computer system or public utility.</p>
        <p>But organizations monitoring performance yesterday said there were no signs yet of major problems. One broad measure of all equipment on the Internet, including local service providers and some customers, showed a slow decline in the percentage of sites reachable during the day on the Internet as a whole and the World Wide Web in particular, but that may have happened because some Internet users disconnected as a precautionary measure, said John S. Quarterman, chief executive of Matrix Information and Directory Services, which publishes Internet performance data.</p>
        <p>Most users stayed wired, though, and the unsubstantiated computer rumors and anecdotes for which the Internet is infamous began flowing within hours of the arrival of Jan. 1 in Asia. One breathless e-mail message, signed ''familyman,'' claimed that an I.B.M. emergency parts center (later said to be in Pennsylvania) was being swamped by orders from New Zealand and Australia. I.B.M. was scrambling to charter aircraft to meet the demand, it claimed. An hour later an I.B.M. spokesman in Japan issued a sharp denial.</p>
        <p>But as they have regularly been doing with far less fanfare than Y2K activists, workers in the year 2000 project trenches also flocked to Internet yesterday. In the last five years, the Internet has emerged as a major vehicle for distribution of year 2000 reports and data within companies and government agencies, for regulators like the Food and Drug Administration, which used it to provide information on the Year 2000 readiness of medical equipment, and industry groups like Global 2000, a consortium of international banks that gathered and shared data on the readiness of foreign countries.</p>
        <p>Computer companies like Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft have increasingly relied on the Internet to quickly and inexpensively distribute new versions of products or Year 2000 patches. Hewlett-Packard said its Web site listing technical data about the year 2000 status of its various products had received more than three million inquiries.</p>
        <p>One boomlet of traffic yesterday involved a new report of a potential year 2000 problem for computers, traffic lights and military equipment that get radio broadcasts of the time and date from the government's atomic clock in Fort Collins, Colo. Brett Glass, a computer consultant in Laramie, Wyo., had recently discovered that the government had never warned the public that some equipment linked by radio to the clock might need reprogramming or replacement to avoid mistaking today for Jan. 1, 1900. (A government spokesman said last night that only a small number of machines running older DOS operating systems were vulnerable and that it had assumed users were aware of the problem.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Glass's work was relayed rapidly into computer circles mainly through David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer expert who has more than 20,000 people on his e-mail list. ''There is no other way to instantaneously alert so many people of a potential problem,'' said Mr. Farber.</p>
        <p>Or to reassure them. The Australian government reported seven million visitors to its year 2000 site in a matter of hours yesterday, all of whom learned there were no major problems to report.</p>

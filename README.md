# TESA: A Task in Entity Semantic Aggregation for Abstractive Summarization

Link to the paper: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.646/

Our work relies heavily on the New York Times Annotated Corpus, and we don't have the
right to publish any of its data.
For this reason, TESA's dataset cannot be published in a public repository in its current
state.
Once it is re-worked to avoid including any New York Times Annotated Corpus data, it will
be made available on this repository.

**In the meantime, you can ask for access to the dataset by sending an email to
clement.jumel@gmail.com where you justify your access to the New York Time Annotated
Corpus.**

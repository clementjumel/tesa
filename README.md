## Dataset & task

Unfortunately, our work relies on the New York Times Annotated Corpus, and we don't own its copyrights. 
For this reason, TESA's dataset and task, will be made available on the Linguistic Data Consortium's website
(https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/).

## Data creation & loading

We will release TESA's dataset and task in both binary and .csv files. In 
`notebooks/dataset_loading.ipynb`, we provide an example on how to load the data, given the 
corresponding data files.
